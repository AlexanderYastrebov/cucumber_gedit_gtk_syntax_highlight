Special thanks to Ben Mabey who is the author of the Textmate bundle who I 
gathered the language translations from at his github repo here: 
http://github.com/bmabey/cucumber-tmbundle/tree/master

Also a big thanks to Carl Pattie for his assistance with the more tricky parts 
of the Regex matching :)
